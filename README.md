If the player selects the correct answer, show a screen congratulating them for choosing the right option. After a few seconds, display the next question -- this is done without user input.

The scenario is similar for wrong answers and time-outs.

If the player runs out of time, tell the player that time's up and display the correct answer. Wait a few seconds, then show the next question.
